/**
 * This interface defines a function that validates that the signature of validation data is trusted through a validated path
 * to an authorized and trusted source.
 *
 * Typically this means that a CRL must be issued by the entity that issued the certificate being checked for revocation and that
 * an OCSP response is verified by a certificate that is issued directly by the CA that issued the target certificate.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface MUST apply measures to avoid recursive loops in validity checking where validity data
 * to support validation of a certificate is verified through the validated certificate.
