/**
 * Provides a factory that provides an implementation of the PDFSignatureContext interface
 *
 * <p>The PDFSignatureContext interface provides a standard set of functions that can be used to determine
 * the state of a PDF document before and after it was signed such as:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Extract the version of the document that was signed by a particular signature</li>
 *   <li>Determine if a document has non signature updates applied to the document after the document was signed</li>
 *   <li>Determine if a signature covers the visual content that is shown if the full document is displayed</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The logic provided by a PDFSignatureContext implementation can be a moving target and also policy driven.
 * The PDF signature validator needs an implementation of this factory to provide it with a current and relevant version to
 * determine the validity of the signature and whether the signature covers the whole document</p>
